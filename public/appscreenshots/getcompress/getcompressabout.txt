About this app
GetCompress makes PDF and image compression fast, simple, and completely private. Compress PDF files, JPGs, PNGs, and images directly on your device — no uploads, no cloud processing, no tracking. Your files never leave your phone.

Reduce file size in seconds using an easy safe-to-strong compression slider, or switch to advanced controls when you need precise results. Preserve text, links, and readability for documents, or push maximum compression when file size matters most.
